Doodle with strangers on InterWeb!


This is a very simple multi-user doodling web app, using [PubNub][pubnub] real-time network JavaScript API, that enable you to draw on the canvas with strangers.

This little toy app also supports multiple inputs methods by using `mouse`, `touch`, and `pointer` events do the app is supported on desktop and touch-screen devices, including iOS and Android phones and tablet, and Windows 8 devices.

## Demo

### With PubNub History API

Also, there is another demo with the `history()` API, which preloads the past 50 drowing strokes, while the first demo starts with a fresh canvas.
